# Netrunner Hacking Game

A simple text based hacking game, set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe. Browser based, written in JavaScript using React. If you've no idea how to use a bash terminal, it might be a little slow to play.

Made to try to understand object oriented programming better and to take a stab a SASS. I made a first attempt at this idea during a web devlopment bootcamp, after only three weeks of JS. This first attempt failed but this one I am much happier with.
